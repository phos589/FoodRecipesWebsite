      <p class="grid-text">
          Mediterranean food is a delicious and exciting way to eat, spanning flavors from many cultures and countries from South of Europe to North Africa and the Middle East. There is so much to love about eating Mediterranean, and thankfully it is a balanced and healthy way to eat.
          
          If you've been a reader of our site for any amount of time, you know that we have a large collection of modern Mediterranean recipes that celebrate the many flavors of the sunny region.
          
          And one of the fun rituals I look forward to every December is updating my list with the BEST Mediterranean recipes of this year! I love looking back to see which recipes everyone cooked and enjoyed most this particular year. There are always the Mediterranean food classics like shawarma, falafel, and the all-essential Greek salad, but there are also many brand new recipes with exciting modern twists that have quickly become fan favorites.
