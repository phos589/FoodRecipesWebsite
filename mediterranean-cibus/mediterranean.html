          Mediterranean food is a delicious and exciting way to eat, spanning flavors from many cultures and countries from South of Europe to North Africa and the Middle East. There is so much to love about eating Mediterranean, and thankfully it is a balanced and healthy way to eat.

                </p>
                <p>  
                  <p>Cook the bacon in a large pan over medium heat. Saute the bacon pieces until they're golden and crispy and then remove them with a slotted spoon to a paper towel.</p>
                  <p>Saute the onion and red bell pepper for about one minute to soften..</p>
                  <p>Add the sweet potatoes and spices to the pan and cook for 10-12 minutes. Then place a lid on the pan for the last 5 minutes to further soften the potatoes.</p>
                  <p>Add the bacon and kale to the pan and stir until the kale has just wilted.</p>
                  <p>Create wells in the hash using a spatula. Crack an egg into each well and cook until the eggs are done to your liking. You can also cover the hash with a lid to cook your eggs all the way through.</p>
                  <p>
                  Remove the breakfast hash from heat and season it with a sprinkle of salt, pepper, and sliced green onion. Serve and enjoy!
