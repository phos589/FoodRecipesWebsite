      <h1>Baklava</h1>
      <p class="description">Baklava is a sumptuous dessert originating from the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. This sweet delicacy is crafted by layering thin sheets of flaky phyllo dough, generously brushed with melted butter and a touch of syrup. Between these layers, a lavish filling of chopped nuts, often including pistachios, walnuts, or almonds, creates a rich and nutty texture. After baking to golden perfection, the entire creation is infused with a fragrant sugar or honey syrup that seeps into the layers, giving each bite an exquisite balance of crispy, buttery goodness and delightful sweetness.</p>
