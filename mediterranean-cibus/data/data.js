Steps: [{
  stepOne:"In a bowl, mix the flour and salt. Add the cubed butter and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, a tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.",
  stepTwo:"On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough into a thin sheet. Fold the dough in half, then in half again. Roll it out once more, and fold again. Repeat this process a couple of times to create layers.  ",
  stepThree:"Roll out the dough once more to about 1/8 inch thickness. Cut the dough into squares or circles, about 4-5 inches in size. Place a spoonful of your chosen filling (ricotta or meat) in the center of each square or circle.",
  stepFour:"Fold the dough over the filling to form a triangle or half-moon shape. Press the edges to seal. Place the filled pastizzi on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with a beaten egg for a golden finish. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until the pastizzi are golden and crispy.",
  stepFive:"Let the pastizzi cool slightly before serving. Enjoy your pastizzi warm as a delicious snack or appetizer.",
